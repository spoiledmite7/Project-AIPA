Artificial Intelligence Personal Assistant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AIPA is a personal assistant that has artificial intelligence that will be later on added. AIPA  will have many features is to it. AIPA is a six-year project and motion.  the plan is to be open to the public and to make the newest end latest Smart Home personal assistant that is open source. the list below will describe the things AIPA will have.

__ Indivigal speaker control and multi speaker control # Example can tell AIPA to play in only two certain rooms of a certain songs

AIPA will arrange to have speakers and microphones in each house room and have a system like Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry Pi will be able to comprehend if AIPA  is getting talked to and different rooms simultaneously. 
The plane will be able to find various commands at the same time.
There will be an override command where AIPA  will outplay through every speaker in the house end speak the command.
There will be a certain saying for this override. Smart devices will be connected through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi through the house. 
Using the function of the Internet of Things will help run all these protocols.
If possible, one whole system instead of having individual raspberry pies will be an option,
maybe running different applications of talking or communicating to each other.
Its chance of running one entire system will be a thing.
Then you have to figure out any audio plugin Port for a variety of microphone inputs and decipher
those microphone inputs and be able to hold and retain that information the data given all at once to the computer if that is possible.
We’ll go the way of one whole system. Bullet points will be listed below of the things expected from AIPA, 
describing how each part is going to work. Later on, we’ll be drawn outs how it will work. 
But overall, the first call that should be made is making a personal assistant and building on top of that and making one step at a time.
